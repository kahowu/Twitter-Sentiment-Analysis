This directory contains all the resources required to define the features used in buildarff.py.

config:
    The main configuration file for defining features
    This file lists all features names, python classes used to extract the features, as well as the
    feature value types.

*.py:
    Feature extracter classes

FeatureExtracter.py:
    The abstract base class of all extracters
    Declares an 'extract' interface function that takes in sentences from a tweet and returns a
    feature value.

TokenFeatureExtracter.py:
    Number of tokens matching the given targets
    Takes in a resource file containing the token matching targets

TagFeatureExtracter.py:
    Number of tag matching the given targets
    Takes in a resource file containing the tag matching targets

EllipsisExtracter.py:
    Number of ellipsis in a tweet

FutureTenseExtracter.py:
    Number of future-tense words

SentCountExtracter.py:
    Number of sentences

SentLengthExtracter.py:
    Average sentence length

TokenLengthExtracter.py:
    Average token length

UpperCaseWordExtracter.py:
    Number of upper case words with length >= 2

/res:
    Lists of token/tag matching targets


ADDING/REMOVING FEATURES:
    Our feature definition framework is modular in that adding and removing features is simple.
    To add a feature, simply add a line in 'config' file with feature name, value type, and the 
    extracter name. One can either reuse an existing extracter or implement one's own by extending
    from the abstract base class FeatureExtracter.py. To remove a feature, remove the line
    correpsonding to that feature from 'config'.
